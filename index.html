<p>Cats &amp; Dogs &amp; Co (in further text CDC) is service intended for tracking your pets. </p>

<p>Contrary to all other similar projects where you buy "tracking band" this is do-it-yourself project. We provide two Web Services (Soap JAX-WS) where you can get your data (to use in your application) or send your data from "Tracker".</p>

<h2>
<a id="tracking-software" class="anchor" href="#tracking-software" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tracking Software</h2>

<p>Most of companies allow you to buy their tracker and then you can follow it's location on their web site. Our service is not like that... We actually don't have display on Web, but you can use other means to get and see your data. (We might create simple Web site in the future where there will be possible to add user, animals and see location, but this is not planned at the moment)
1. Making your own application and using supplied Web Services
2. Use one of our application: 
    2a) .NET application. This simple Windows application which can be used until our "official" application comes out. If you are Windows user 
        you can try this out, or else wait a little longer and 2b will be out. COMMING in November 2015.
    2b) Java application. Application for displaying location data, this is actually official application for this service. Client is open 
        source and can be extended by users (running on Sourceforge/GIT). COMMING IN 1st Quarter of 2016.</p>

<h2>
<a id="tracker" class="anchor" href="#tracker" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tracker</h2>

<p>Like I said most companies have product which can be used for tracking your animal... we don't. Idea of whole project was to either build your own tracker, which can then send data to our service, or use old phone to do that for you.</p>

<h3>
<a id="use-your-old-android-phone" class="anchor" href="#use-your-old-android-phone" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Use your old (Android) phone</h3>

<p>Now this is probably the cheapest sollution. Use your old Phone, or buy some cheap one (you can get cheap Android 4 phone for under 50 EUR). Phone needs to have GPS though. Most of old Android 4.x phones have that, but make sure before you get. Now you need "data SIM card" of one of your Mobile Phone Service Providers (you can get that cheap too in most countries</p>

<h3>
<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to GitHub Pages.</h3>

<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">using GitHub Flavored Markdown</a>, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new <code>gh-pages</code> branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.</p>

<h3>
<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Creating pages manually</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
